About
This is a capstone project to research SpaceX's launch data, for the IBM Coursera Data Science course. The Jupyter notebooks contain data collection, data processing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models to make predictions about SpaceX rocket launches.

      1 - SpaceX Data Collection using the SpaceX API
      2 - SpaceX Data COllection using Webscraping from Wikipedia
      3 - SpaceX Data Wrangling - focus on NumPy & Pandas
      4 - SpaceX Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL
      5 - SpaceX Data Visualization with matplotlib
      6 - SpaceX Launch Site Analysis with Folium
      7 - SpaceX launch predictions - with ML library scikit-learn
      8 - SpaceX Launch Analysis Dashboard script with Dash and Plotly
